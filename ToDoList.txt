Issues

:: ---- :: The issue arises when rows containing columns that are not present
           in the table are added. In such cases, an error should occur, but 
           it currently doesn't. Here's an example to illustrate the problem:

           self.table = Table("MyTable")
           self.table.add_column("Name", "text")
           self.table.add_column("Age", "integer")
           self.table.add_column("City", "date")
           self.table.add_column("Completed", "boolean")   
           data_to_insert = [
               [
                   {"column-name": "Name", "value": "John"},
                   {"column-name": "Age", "value": 30},
                   {"column-name": "Active", "value": True},
               ],
               # More rows with "Active" column, which is not defined in the table
           ]
