## Branch: Pre-Production

The 'pre-production' branch of the SQL Engine Library hosts the most recent developments. During the pre-production phase, I create prototype of future product, design internal connections, and investigate potential solutions and challenges. I utilize the Python programming language for efficient and rapid prototype development.
